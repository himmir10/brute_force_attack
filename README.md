This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a brute force attack on a password-protected ZIP file. Please note that this code is intended for educational purposes only and should be used responsibly and legally.

To run the code, you will need the following:

A Python interpreter (Python 3.x recommended).
The zipfile library, which is typically included in standard Python distributions.

Follow these steps to understand and use the code:

1. Clone or download the code repository to your local system.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the pro.py file in a text editor or Python IDE to review the code. Please ensure you understand the code thoroughly before proceeding.
4. Important: Only use this code on ZIP files for which you have explicit permission and legal ownership. Unauthorized or malicious use is strictly prohibited and illegal.
5. Download the zip file protected.zip (Password:1234).
6. Define the path of zip file in the pro.py .
7. The code will attempt to decrypt the ZIP file using the provided character set("ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefdgijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890~!@#$%^&*()_") you can modify character set as per yor wish. If successful, it will display the correct password, number of attempts and time taken. If not, it will notify you accordingly.

Legal and Ethical Considerations:

Use this code responsibly: Always ensure that you have explicit permission and legal rights to perform a brute force attack on a ZIP file.

Obey local laws and regulations: The unauthorized access to files or systems is illegal and unethical. Respect all applicable laws and ethical guidelines in your region.

Education and research: This code is meant for educational and research purposes, promoting awareness of security vulnerabilities and responsible use.
